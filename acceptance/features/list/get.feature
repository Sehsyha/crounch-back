  Scenario: OK - List contains products with their categories
    Given I authenticate with a random user
    And I create these lists
      | Name    |
      | Courses |
    And I create these products
      | Name    |
      | Caviar  |
    And I use this body
      """
        {
          "productId": "{{ .ProductID }}",
          "listId": "{{ .ListID }}"
        }
      """
    And I send a "POST" request on "/lists/{{ .ListID }}/products/{{ .ProductID }}"
    And I send a "POST" request on "/lists/{{ .ListID }}/products/40fe3f75-703a-46d8-9520-0d27f7cf4bab"
